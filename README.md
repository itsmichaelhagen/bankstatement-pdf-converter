This is a PDF to CSV converter for paperless bank statements from Fifth Third Bank. It has not been tested on any other bank statement, but may work. If you use this, check the "Identify Vendors" section of the file and add vendors that are on your bank statement. The formatting is [[Vendor Description from Transaction], [Vendor Name], [Vendor Category]]. Once added, you won't need to add again.
