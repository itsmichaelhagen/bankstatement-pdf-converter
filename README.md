This is a PDF to CSV converter for paperless bank statements from Fifth Third Bank. It has not been tested on any other bank statement, but may work. There is still a lot of work to make this a seamless converter. Currently, it can pull transactions based on the dates because all of the transactions on Fifth Third bank statements start with the date. Eventually, it will isolate the date, transaction balance, transaction type (withdrawl or deposit), vendor (purchase from or deposit from), and transaction category.
